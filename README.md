JPC Amazon Warehouse Simulation

## Design TODO list
* Update UML (UML worth 10%) (Try to ensure no notation flaws as this should get us upto at least 60-69)
* Group Reports (Worth 5%)
  * Overall description
  * ~~Evaluation~~

## Development TODO list
* ~~GUI~~
  * ~~Remove unused Help menu item~~
  * ~~Try to make text fields for speed & capacity equal~~
  * ~~Make multi tick entry a little bigger (Display 3 characters - probably same size as speed/capacity)~~
  
* Tidy up
  * Do last sweep of naming conventions (Mark: 60-69) 
    (Most of model has been done with the exception of: Floor & WarehouseSimulation, 
     I haven't checked the other packages) 
  * Ensure everything has a javadoc comment (If we've done everything else well this could get us 80+) (Same applies here as above)

## Testing TODO list
 * RobotTest (Mark: 50-59)
 * File input/output (Mark: 70-79)
